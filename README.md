# Multifactor-Authenticator 
# 🔐 Multifactor Authenticator (TOTP-Based)

*Multifactor Authenticator* is a Python-based tool that implements *Time-Based One-Time Passwords (TOTP)* for secure authentication. Developed by *DolapotheEthicalHacker*, this project mimics the core functionality of mobile authenticator apps like Google Authenticator and Authy, making it ideal for learning or integrating two-factor authentication (2FA) into your own Python applications.

## 🚀 What It Does

This project demonstrates a basic but functional *multi-factor authentication system*. It generates a secret key for each user, encodes it as a QR code, and then uses it to verify one-time passwords generated by an external authenticator app synced with that QR code.

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ *TOTP Algorithm Support* — based on RFC 6238 standards.
- 📱 *QR Code Generation* — for quick setup with authenticator apps.
- 🔄 *OTP Synchronization* — works with Google Authenticator, Authy, and other TOTP apps.
- 🧪 *Simple Verification Flow* — enter your generated OTP to test.
- 🛡 *Foundation for Secure Systems* — easily extendable into full login workflows.

## 📁 File Structure

- **file1.py** – Main script containing:
  - Secret key generation
  - TOTP object initialization using pyotp
  - QR code generation using qrcode and pillow
  - OTP verification logic

---

## 🖥 Example Use Case

1. Generate a TOTP secret key.
2. Display a QR code for the user to scan.
3. The user scans the code with their mobile app (Google Authenticator/Authy).
4. User enters the OTP shown on their app.
5. The script verifies the OTP for authentication.

---

## 🛠 Requirements

Before you run the script, make sure Python 3 is installed. Then install the required libraries:

bash
pip install pyotp qrcode pillow


---

## ✅ How to Run

Once pasted, save it as `README.md` in your project folder, then run:

bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "Added README file"
git push
1. Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/Dolapotheethicalhacker/Multifactor-Authenticator.git

cd Multifactor-Authenticator


2. Run the Python script:

bash
python3 file1.py


3. Scan the displayed QR code with your authenticator app and enter the OTP to test authentication.

## 📌 Notes

- TOTP tokens are time-sensitive and change every 30 seconds.
- Ensure your device clock is in sync for proper verification.
- This is intended for educational or internal use — always follow secure practices when deploying authentication systems in production.
